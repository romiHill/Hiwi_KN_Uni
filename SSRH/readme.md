# SSRH (Smooth Signal Redunancy) Project
The Smooth Signal Redundancy Hypothesis (Aylett 2000, based on Shannon 1948 and Lindblom 1990) assumes that the recognition likelihood of linguistic items is spread evenly throughout the utterance to ensure robust and efficient communication between speaker and listener.

...

Based on evidence of shared effects of language redundancy and prosodic prominence on syl-lable duration and vowel quality, Aylett (2000) andAylett and Turk (2004, 2006) proposed that smooth signalredundancy is controlled via prosodic phonology, specifically via prosodic prominence structure.

...

Our goal for this project is to provide a test of the Prosodic Interface Hypothesis, and to model language redundancy effects and the prosodic interface in a formal model of grammar

## duration/
Scripts & data to identify segments whose durations are longer than expected, potentially due to language redunancy effects.

## perception_study
Scripts to prepare data for input into FindingFive.

## edinburgh
Scripts & data produced while visiting Edinburgh, primarily to identify differences in annotations between the forced aligner and gold standard.
